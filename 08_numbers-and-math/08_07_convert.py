# Demonstrate how to:
# -------------------
# 1) Convert an int to a float

num = 5
num = float(num)
print (num)

# 2) Convert a float to an int

num = 5.0
num = int(num)
print (num)

# 3) Perform division using a float and an int.

num_one = 1.0
num_two = 2
print(num_one / num_two)

# 4) Use two variables to perform a multiplication.

print (num_one * num_two)

# What information is lost during which conversions?
# The data type int is lost when using equations that involve a float.
